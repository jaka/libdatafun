#libdatafun

libdatafun consists of few functions that simplify sending data from any application to [data.sparkfun.com](https://data.sparkfun.com/) online stream storage. For an example of usage see `upload.c` where each line is self-explanatory. Files actually needed by an application are located in `src` directory.

Files could be used and modified by anyone.
